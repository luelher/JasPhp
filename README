JasPhp

Micro Framework for Reporting using Jasper Report and Php

Application that allows you to generate reports quickly and easily
using techniques such as RAD scallfold, configuration conventions
and parameterization using yml files.

PHP is used to present the "Form Settings"
for the user to "Filter" the data you want to be displayed in reports.
This form is "parameterized" by a .yml file which describes
what you want to be filtered by the user before generating the reports.
The report is otherwise designed and generated by Jasper Report libraries.

This integration of PHP and Jasper Report does not use any interface or "Bridget"
between languages​​, which makes it much easier and portable deployment
of reports.

This project is the result of years of evolution of various concepts
and needs of the company where I work. For this project I must give credit
personnel working in the company CIDESA, since there arises the need.

For comments, observations and contributions.

* Crear pruebas funcionales
* Integración de algún proceso de autenticación. Se sugiere algún plugin para silex
* Cambiar la librería de jasper para exportar otros formatos.
